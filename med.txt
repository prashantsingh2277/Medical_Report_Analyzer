Disease: Early type II diabetes

Possible Medicines:

 Metformin: Improves insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance
 Thiazolidinediones (Pioglitazone, Rosiglitazone): Enhances insulin sensitivity
 Sulfonylureas (Glimepiride, Glipizide): Stimulates insulin secretion
 Meglitinides (Repaglinide, Nateglinide): Promotes insulin release after meals
 DPP-4 Inhibitors (Sitagliptin, Saxagliptin): Enhances insulin secretion and reduces glucagon levels
 GLP-1 Analogues (Exenatide, Liraglutide): Stimulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon release
 SGLT2 Inhibitors (Canagliflozin, Empagliflozin): Blocks glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to increased glucose excretion in the urine
